# CS598-Final-Project
Code uploaded for final project of CS598

This is an exported Google Colab sheet that contains my efforts to reproduce and extend upon code used in the research paper “Hidden Stratification Causes Clinically Meaningful Failures in Machine Learning for Medical Imaging” (citation below). This is not a perfect reproduction, merely my attempts at replicating and extending a portion of the author's code.

Dependencies: This code successfully ran in Google Colab using the default environment and built-in libraries as of May 7, 2025.

To see the results of this code, run the blocks of code in order.
